### Git Philosophy
* Speed
* Simple design
* Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)
* Fully distributed
* Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)
* Strong data integrity

---

### Concepts
* Distribution through Local Repositories
* Filesystem "snapshots" instead of individually versioned files
* SHA-1 Checksums and Commit ids
* Branching
* Staging area

### Rebasing

--

> "If you treat rebasing as a way to clean up and work with commits before you push them, and if you only rebase commits that have never been available publicly, then youâ€™ll be fine. If you rebase commits that have already been pushed publicly, and people may have based work on those commits, then you may be in for some frustrating trouble."
