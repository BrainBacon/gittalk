### Git Philosophy
* Speed
* Simple design
* Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)
* Fully distributed
* Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)
* Strong data integrity

---

### What we'll cover
* Installation
* Setup and configuration
* Initializing a repository
* Staging files
* Status and log
* Ignoring files
* Committing files
* Branching
* Merging branches
* Tagging
* Remote repositories

---

### Getting Started
* Linux installation: 

  - Red Hat

        sudo yum install git-core

  - Debian

        sudo apt-get install git

* OSX installation:
  - Standard installation

    [`http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer`](http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer)

  - With Macports:

        sudo port install git-core +svn +doc +bash_completion +gitweb

* Windows installation:

  [`http://msysgit.github.com/`](http://msysgit.github.com/)

--

### Git Setup
* Identity

      $ git config --global user.name "Brian Jesse"
      $ git config --global user.email brianj@wolfram.com

* Editor

      $ git config --global core.editor vim

* Diff Tool

      $ git config --global merge.tool vimdiff

* Test settings

      $ git config --list
      user.name=Brian Jesse
      user.email=brianj@wolfram.com
      diff.tool=vimdiff
      core.editor=vim

* CLI arguments

  - `--global` will modify for the current user
  - `--system` will modify for the entire system

--

### Configuration Files
* Local:

  `.git/config`

*  User: 

  `~/.gitconfig` <span style="font-size:0.7em;">(`%USERPROFILE%/.gitconfig` in windows)</span>

* Global: 

  `/etc/gitconfig`

\* *Configuration directive priority is in this order*

--

### Getting Help

    $ git help <verb>
    $ git <verb> --help
    $ man git-<verb>

---

### Initializing a repository 

    $ git init

* This creates a .git folder in the current directory.
* Git only requires one folder at the root of the project
* The .git folder contains the whole repository and history

--

### Staging files

    $ git add .
    $ git add *.clj
    $ git add README

* This has to be done before every commit if you wish to use the staging area
* You only have to do this when you want the repository to track a new file if you use the `-a` option when committing.

--

### Status and log

* Status

      $ git status
      # On branch master
      # Changes not staged for commit:
      #   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
      #   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
      #
      #	modified:   resources/public/md/gittalk.md
      #
      no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

* Log

      $ git log -1
      commit 1a071baaf24488663ca7242937abbba2c21c714e
      Author: Brian Jesse <brianj@wolfram.com>
      Date:   Tue Jun 25 14:16:41 2013 -0500

          Moved app to Reveal.js

  - Log will take a number as an argument (the number of log messages to print)

--

### Ignoring files

* put a .gitignore file in the project root

      $ cat .gitignore
      /target
      /lib
      /classes
      /checkouts
      pom.xml
      *.jar
      *.class
      /.lein-*
      /.env
      *.log

* This file should be committed along with other files to your repository and shared among other repositories
* The .gitignore file will accept wildcard syntax and basic regex
* This will silence any status messages for untracked files that you do not want to add.

--

### Committing to the repository

    $ git commit -m 'Finished getting started'
    [master a62f5ca] Finished getting started
     1 file changed, 211 insertions(+), 3 deletions(-)

  - This does not put your data on the server
  - The `-a` option tells git to automatically add all modified and deleted files but will not add new ones
  - A commit is a snapshot of the entire repository (in contrast to CVS where you version and commit individual files)

---

### Branching

* Branches are a collection of commits
* They are really cheap to use and quick to set up
* You should use branches often and for individual features/issues
* Checking out a new branch

      $ git checkout -b brian
      M	resources/public/md/gittalk.md
      Switched to a new branch 'brian'

* Checking out an existing branch

      $ git checkout master
      Switched to branch 'master'

--

### Merging branches 

    $ git checkout brian
    Switched to branch 'brian'
    $ git merge master
    Updating 1a071ba..a62f5ca
    Fast-forward
     resources/public/md/gittalk.md |  214 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++---
     1 file changed, 211 insertions(+), 3 deletions(-)


* Managing merge conflicts
  - Git will create a new commit when merge conflicts occur
  - Any files that now have merge conflicts will have resolution markers in them
  - Git will also add local, remote, and base versions of the file for you to diff against
  - When you are satisfied with the merge run

        $ git add <filename>
        $ git commit

--

### Tagging

    $ git tag reveal-move 1a07
    $ git log reveal-move -1
    commit 1a071baaf24488663ca7242937abbba2c21c714e
    Author: Brian Jesse <brianj@wolfram.com>
    Date:   Tue Jun 25 14:16:41 2013 -0500

        Moved app to Reveal.js

* Tag a commit by referring to part of its SHA-1 hash id
* Git tags are pointers to a commit
* Can be treated as branches in many ways
* Should not be used for parallel development but should be used for tracking release versions and architectural overhauls.

---

### Remote repositories

* Clone via SSH

      $ git clone brianj@brianjlx:~/Projects/gittalk.git

* Clone via GIT protocol

      $ git clone git://github.com/bajesse/gittalk.git

* Clone via HTTPS

      $ git clone https://bitbucket.org/bajesse/gittalk.git

* Clone via filesystem

      $ git clone /home/brianj/Projects/gittalk

--

### Pushing local commits to a remote repository

    $ git push origin master

* This will push the branch "master" to the remote server "origin" 
* You must have write access to the remote repository
* This will only work if the branch you are pushing to is not checked out in the remote working directory
* When creating central remote repositories it makes more sense to either create or clone a repository with the `--bare` option so there is no working directory.

--

### Pulling changes from a remote repository

    $ git pull origin master

* this will initiate a merge with the content from the "master" branch on the remote repository

    $ git fetch

* this loads all repository data from a remote server but will not initiate a merge.

--

### Remote Management

    $ git remote -v
    origin	git@github.com:bajesse/gittalk.git (fetch)
    origin	git@github.com:bajesse/gittalk.git (push)

* add a new remote repository

      $ git remote add brianjlx brianj@brianjlx:Projects/gittalk

* remove a remote repository

      $ git remote rm brianjlx

### Advanced Concepts
* Rebasing
  > "If you treat rebasing as a way to clean up and work with commits before you push them, and if you only rebase commits that have never been available publicly, then youâ€™ll be fine. If you rebase commits that have already been pushed publicly, and people may have based work on those commits, then you may be in for some frustrating trouble."
